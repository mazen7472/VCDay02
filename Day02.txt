What is a Pull Request and Request & Difference Between Them?
Pull Request (PR): A GitHub feature to propose, review, and merge changes from one branch or repository to another.
Request: Likely refers to a Merge Request (GitLab’s equivalent to a PR) or a general change request.
Difference:
Pull Request: GitHub-specific term for proposing and merging changes.
Merge Request: GitLab’s term for the same process. Both use git merge or rebase internally but differ in platform and UI.

Switch to the new-email branch:
git checkout new-email

Push the rebased branch:
git push -f origin new-email
